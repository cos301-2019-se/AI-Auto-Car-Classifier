# AI-Auto Car Classifier

## **ControlAltElite**


**Project description**
* AI-Auto-Car-Classifier is a web application aimed at automating the process of adding cars to a salespersons inventory of cars. This means, given a cars image, the system should be able to identify the cars make, model and color while also extracting the vehicles number plate if it exists. The application is also available as a service for boom gates. This means for gates that take images of cars, they can either choose to only retrieve the cars details(and store them in their own database) or use the apps database.
